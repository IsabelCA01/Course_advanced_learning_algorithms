    "- A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represents classification rules.\n"

    "- In an iterative process, the algorithm continues to split the data at each node it reaches until the leaves are pure. This means that the samples at each leaf node all belong to the same class.\n",
